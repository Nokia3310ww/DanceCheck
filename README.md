# ðŸŽ¯ Dance Pose Evaluation Game

ðŸ“Œ **This project is functional, though thereâ€™s still room for improvement ðŸ˜„**  
Run the game with:

```bash
python dancegame_fully.py


âœ… Features
Real-time pose tracking â€“ Uses MediaPipe to detect human body keypoints

Motion similarity comparison â€“ Calculates pose differences using FastDTW

Error calculation â€“ Displays real-time error percentage

Movement accuracy scoring â€“ Evaluates how accurately the user imitates the benchmark video

âš  Known Issues
Video playback sometimes lags â€“ needs optimization for smoother playback

Audio delay issue

ðŸ“„ File Descriptions
move_comparison.py
Compares dance movements between the webcam feed and a pre-recorded pose video to measure accuracy for each frame.
