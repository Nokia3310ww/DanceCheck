📌 This project is functional, though there’s still room for improvement 😄
Run the game with dancegame_fully.py

✅ Real-time pose tracking – Uses MediaPipe to detect human body keypoints
✅ Motion similarity comparison – Calculates pose differences using FastDTW
✅ Error calculation – Displays real-time error percentage
✅ Movement accuracy scoring – Evaluates how accurately the user imitates the benchmark video

❌ Video playback sometimes lags – needs optimization for smoother playback
❌ Audio delay issue

📄 move_comparison.py
Used to compare dance movements between the webcam feed and a pre-recorded pose video to measure accuracy for each frame.

📄 pose_module.py
Pose detection module using MediaPipe for extracting human body keypoints.
